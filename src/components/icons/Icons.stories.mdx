## Overview

The Local Components Icon system is meant to standardize the icon implementation across Local projects and make those icons more discoverable within Storybook.

### üéØ Objectives

1. A unified Icon system with a single approach
1. Explicit width and height so icons don't resize and flicker when the app or a particular view is shown
1. The option to neutralize svg colors out of the box for consistency and predictability
1. Ability to override icon colors with a single `className` selector without using `!important` or nested selectors
1. Allow each icon to define their own metadata for ease of discovery and implementation
1. Dual export system that allows for importing via single namespace or individual component references
1. Icons should allow additional, unknown props to be passed through and applied

### üèó Adding a new svg icon

1. Create a new icon component within `./src/components/icons/svgs/`
1. Copy the new svg markup to the rendered component
    1. Add `{...props}` to svg props to allow for maximum flexibility of common props without explicitly setting them
    1. The props 'xmlns' and 'data-name' can optionally be removed
1. Explicitly set `width` and `height` props of svg to match rounded viewport size
1. Provide meta details to make this icon more discoverable within storybook example in 1 of 2 ways:
    1. Wrap component in `withIconSvg` hoc
    1. Add prototype property `meta` with details
1. Export component and add to `Icons.tsx` namespace and export
    1. Note: this will automatically include icons in the searchable storybook example via reflection

### ‚ÅâÔ∏è Q&A

#### Why does the svg size flicker at an absurdly large size before scaling down to a reasonable size?

Chances are, the exported svg xml does not include an explicit `width` and `height` attribute
but a developer can add this after the fact.

#### Why use `<svg>` and not `<img>`?

The problem with both `<img>` and background-images is that you don‚Äôt get to control the innards of the svg.

#### Why does `Icons.tsx` export both a namespace and object of objects?

This setup allows icons to be imported and implemented in a dual export approach similar to React. See the [Ways to import icons](#ways-to-import-icons) section of this documentation.

### üìù Todo Improvements

* Remove old svgs when it's confirmed that they're no longer being used (src/svg/*)
* Break-up and componentize IconsStoriesAll (including helpers like `// filter out non-matching icons`)
* How to handle larger icons? scale for story? show scale %?
* Show icon dimensions in preview
* How to manage colors?
* Show no results and hide footer
* Sort by relevance


## All Icons

<Canvas>
	<Story name="All Icons">
		// note: this layout is tricky and `max-height` is specifically used here and must match the examples `max-height: 100%` style */
		<div style={{ maxHeight: '90vh', display: 'flex' }}>
			<IconsStoriesAll />
		</div>
	</Story>
</Canvas>

## Ways to Import Icons <a id="ways-to-import-icons" />

There are two ways of importing and using icons from the `local-components` project:

1. Individual named import
2. Icons namespaced import

```javascript
// Individual named import
import { AddIcon } from "./Icons";
// ...
<AddIcon />
// ...
```

```javascript
// Icons namespaced import
import { Icons } from "./Icons";
// ...
<Icons.Add />
// ...
```

<Canvas>
<Story name="Import Icons">
<div><p>Individual named import: <code>&lt;AddIcon /&gt;</code></p> <AddIcon /></div>
<div><p>Icons namespaced import: <code>&lt;Icons.Add /&gt;</code></p> <Icons.Add /></div>
</Story>
</Canvas>

## Working with individual icons

Individual icon properties can be overwritten when calling the icon component. For example, omitting the `width` and `height` will use the default values, but we can explicitly pass values to override those defaults.

Note that some icons allow for different styling depending on the size. For example, the `CircleInfoIcon` has a heavier weight at small sizes, and a lighter stroke when using `size='large'`. Note the visual differences comparing a `size='large'` value vs explicitly setting a large `width` and `height`.

Default, small styling for the `CircleInfoIcon`:

<Canvas>
	<Story name="Default small icon">
		<CircleInfoIcon />
	</Story>
</Canvas>

Using the `large` size as well as custom `width` and `height` values.

<Canvas>
	<Story name="Differen sizes - using the large size">
		<CircleInfoIcon size='large' />
		<CircleInfoIcon size='large' width='64' height='64' />
	</Story>
</Canvas>
