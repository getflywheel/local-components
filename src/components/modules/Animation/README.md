Animations are managed via `react-move`. There are two types of animation categories: a single element and a group of elements.

Group example of list items with add/remove animations:

```js
import Example1 from './examples/AnimationExample';

<Example1 />
```

Element example of modal animation.

```js
import Example2 from './examples/AnimationExample2';

<Example2 />
```
