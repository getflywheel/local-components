VirtualTable is a table of visible and overscan rows that are virtually swapped in and out while being positioned within a statically set scroll area that represents the size of all items (as if they were being rendered in their entirety).
This component builds upon VirtualList.

Interactive Example:

```js
import { VirtualTableExample } from './examples/VirtualTableExample';

<VirtualTableExample />
```
