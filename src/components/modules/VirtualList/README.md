VirtualList is a largely unstyled series of visible and overscan rows that are virtually swapped in and out while being positioned within a statically set scroll area that represents the size of all items (as if they were being rendered in their entirety).

Interactive example:

```js
import { VirtualListExample } from './examples/VirtualListExample';

<VirtualListExample />
```
