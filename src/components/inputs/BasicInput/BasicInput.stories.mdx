import BasicInput from "./BasicInput";
import { Meta, Story, Canvas } from "@storybook/addon-docs/blocks";

<Meta title="Inputs/BasicInput" component={BasicInput} />

BasicInput functions just the same as `InputPasswordToggle`, without the password dots or the toggling. So, you know, like a basic input field.

<Canvas>
	<Story name="BasicInput">
        <BasicInput onChange={(event) => console.log('onChange: ', event)} />
	</Story>
</Canvas>
