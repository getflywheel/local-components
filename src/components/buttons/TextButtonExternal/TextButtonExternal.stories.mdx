# Examples

The default underline behavior of TextButtonExternal is to underline on hover. This is adequate for links that stand alone in a design, outside of the context of any other text.

<Canvas>
	<Story name="Default">
        <TextButtonExternal href="javascript:;">I'm a default TextButtonExternal</TextButtonExternal>
	</Story>
</Canvas>

Setting the `underline` prop to true means the link will always be underlined. This is suitable for links that exist in the context of surrounding text.

<Canvas>
	<Story name="Underlined and Heavy">
		<p>
			Here is some text with an&nbsp;
		<TextButtonExternal href="javascript:;" underline heavy>inline heavy underlined link</TextButtonExternal>
		!
		</p>
	</Story>
</Canvas>

Finally, to fully remove the underline, explicity set the `unerline` prop to `false`

<Canvas>
	<Story name="No underline">
        <TextButtonExternal href="javascript:;" underline={false}>I'm a default TextButtonExternal</TextButtonExternal>
	</Story>
</Canvas>
