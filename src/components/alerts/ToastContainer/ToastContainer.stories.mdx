<Meta title="Alerts/ToastContainer" component={ToastContainerExample} />

We use [react-toastify](https://fkhadra.github.io/react-toastify/introduction) for our Toasts, and from Local Components we export a wrapper around their `toast` function and `ToastContainer` component.
This is done to limit the interface to better suit our specific designs.

## ToastContainer

Local will use only one instance of `ToastContainer` wrapping the whole app, though a multi-container approach is possible and would require further implementation.
See the [react-toastify docs](https://fkhadra.github.io/react-toastify/multi-containers) for more information on multi-container toasts.
## toast()

To trigger a Toast, import `toast` from Local Components (NOT `react-toastify`!) and call the function with an appropriate `options` object to customize.
You may specify `style`, `className`, `toastId`, `autoClose`, `content` and `type` properties, think React props but as an arg object.

`autoClose` is a number specifying the length in ms after which to close the toast.

`content` must be a valid React child - i.e. a string, component, or JSX. Note that in lieu of greater abstraction, all Toast content must be passed and styled from outside of the component.
Although many toasts may want a text button to the right (think "undo" or "Learn more"), keeping components more flexible often serves us well in the future.

View the code in `ToastContainerEample.tsx` for detailed examples of how to implement different kinds of toasts, shown below.
